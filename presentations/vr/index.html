                This is my note.
                  - there are many like it
                  - but this is mine
                
                                
                Explain that the talk will be primarily about VR in gaming

                - In a more user friendly text. It means that its a computer created world that can be either 
                  -- From a real world place (such as maybe up the Eiffel tower) 
                  -- From an imaginary place (Such as Middle Earth)
                
                - Usually to experience the created world some special piece of hardware is needed, currently the most popular hardware is some form of headset that displays to the user the world as they look around. This is usually accompanied with sound from a pair of headphones so they can get sensory immersion. - More on this later

              <h2>A <small>small</small> History of VR</h2>
              
              <aside class="notes"/>
                There has been many simulations for many years, such as driving simulators and those large simulator machines you see in arcades or the London science museum.
                Gamings VR really started in 1992 When Jonathon Walderns company W Industries launched "Virtuality" which was an arcade Virtual reality experience, that had users wearing some googles and used small handsets to play.
                
                In 1995 Nintendo released the "Virtual Boy" which was meant to be a virtual reality machine, unfortunately this was a huge failure and was discontinued the following year. 
                
                After this Virtual reality in gaming hit a stand still in gaming for many years. And nothing major hit the markets.

                - Via Audio - With the surround sound headsets people can get, its already possible to hear where a sound originates from, so there is not as much to develop here.
                - Via Visual - Visual work is currently being actively developed, with devices such as the Oculus Rift, and Sonys Project Morpheous.
                - Via Haptic feedback - Haptic feedback being the simulation of touch, or impact. Currently there are Haptic feedback vests available, but it has not really hit the mainstream.
                - Via Smell - I'm not aware of anything actively being developed to simulate the sense of smell.
                - Via Movement - Movement, as in training simulations and gaming movement is a key part. There are currently devices dedicated to this, but at a very high price, there is the Virtuix Omni, which is an all direction treadmill so as you walk, your avatar in the simulation will as well. Although this will set you back about $500.
                - Via BrainWaves / Nerve impulses - Complete control/immersion using brainwaves or nerve impulses. Being able to think of doing something and it happens in a virtual world. You think of lifting your arm as if in the real world, and your avatar does it.
